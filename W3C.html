		<h1>W3C</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p><strong>W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)</strong> is an international community where member organizations work together as a full-time team of work and other contributors to develop web standards.</p>
		<h2>What is W3C?</h2>
			<p>Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web by developing the first client program in 1990, after developing the first server infrastructure, httpd, in 1989. Later, W3C was founded by Berners-Lee in 1994, and the organization’s official website is <u>w3.org</u></p>
			<p>The World Wide Web Consortium was founded in October 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee in the computer science lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Later, in April 1995, INRIA became the first host of the W3C in Europe, followed by service at the Japanese Keio University in Asia in 1996.</p>
			<p>In 2003, the ERCIM (European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics) center replaced INRIA and continued to serve.</p>
			<p>The goal of Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, one of the creators of the web, is to develop various protocols in the long term and to create an interactive environment that suits the users’ exact needs.</p>
			<p>Some of the standards used on the web are HTML, XML, and CSS. These standards include the W3C Patent Policy, which allows them to be freely used by the entire Web community.</p>
			<p>The W3C Consortium successfully fulfills its mission of developing quality standards through an effective process that connects organizations, staff, and society.</p>
		<h2>Targets</h2>
		<h3>A Suitable Website for Everyone</h3>
			<p>One of its main goals is to help create a website that everyone can use. Thus, it allows for communication, trade, service, and opportunities to share information between individuals.</p>
			<p>Its main purpose is to obtain such benefits regardless of the hardware, software, network infrastructure, mother tongue, culture, geographic location, or physical characteristics of individuals.</p>
		<h3>A Suitable Website for Any Use</h3>
			<p>Many types of different gadgets or browser extensions that can be used on the web have been developed. In this way, communication can be established between mobile phones, smartphones, personal digital assistants, voice response systems, kiosk devices or smart home appliances, and the web, in accordance with various usage needs.</p>
		<h3>Vision</h3>
			<p>The vision of W3C is to be participatory, to share information, and to facilitate communication, thus increasing the sense of trust among users on a global scale.</p>
		<h3>Interactive communication</h3>
			<p>Web technology, which is widely used by everyone today, allows people to easily share information from anywhere.</p>
			<p>In the past, the web system was used only by certain institutions or organizations. However, many types of communication have emerged, such as blogs, wiki pages, social media platforms, and e-commerce systems, due to the evolving technology and increasing usage needs.</p>
			<p>The W3C community has also set new standards to support the infrastructure, architecture, and design of these emerging new technology systems and supported this evolving evolution.</p>
		<h3>Secure Communication</h3>
			<p>Data security is also important when people communicate with each other on the web. The W3C community also addresses security in its efforts to make the web better.</p>
		<h2>Patent Policy</h2>
			<p>W3C adopted a patent policy in February 2004 to validate the international adoption of web standards. This patent policy aims to facilitate the development of recommendations by working groups, aim for their widespread implementation, and address patent issues that may arise.</p>
		<h2>Organizations</h2>
			<p>The Advisory Committee consists of one representative from each W3C Member organization and has various review roles and selects the Advisory Team and TAG.</p>
			<p>TAG (Technical Architecture Group) basically performs the documentation of the principles of Web Architecture. The CEO (Director and Chief Executive Officer) evaluates consensus for all decisions. In addition, groups of representatives of member organizations and expert guests are available.</p>
		<h2>How Are Web Standards Created?</h2>
			<p>To create a Web standard, a controlled process is established that determines the quality of the specification. In this process, all users of the standard are allowed to be tested by considering the information and opinions to create the documents.</p>
			<p>Then, quality standards are obtained by experts in the field, and the technical specifications available to everyone are thoroughly examined before they are accepted as a recommendation or standard.</p>
		<h2>What are the Benefits of Web Standards?</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>It makes the web free and accessible and usable to all.</li>
				<li>It makes the source code understandable by simplifying it.</li>
				<li>It makes the Web more accessible with development processes.</li>
				<li>It provides backward compatibility and validation.</li>
				<li>It provides better search engine optimization.</li>
				<li>It creates a common repository for users.</li>
			</ol>
