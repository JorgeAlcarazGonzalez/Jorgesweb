		<h1>Internet security</h1>
		<h2>Difference between pasive and active security threats</h2>
			<p>Passive attacks have to do with eavesdropping on, or monitoring, transmissions. Electronic mail, file transfers and client/server exchanges are examples of transmissions that can be monitored. Active attacks include the modification of transmitted data and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer system. </p>
		<h2>Malware: <u>worm</u>, <u>trojan</u>, <u>virus</u> and <u>spyware</u></h2>
		<h3>Worm</h3>
			<p>Worms are similar to the Virus, but a worm doesn’t need a <strong>host program</strong> to execute itself, worms are the standalone program. It uses a computer network to spread itself, and it relies on <strong>network loophole and security failure</strong> to travel from one host to another automatically and usually don’t requires user intervention. Since worms don’t require any initiation they can spread <strong>speedily across the network</strong>, infecting every PC in their path, Worms are most well know type of malware which affects more computers than a virus can.</p>
			<img src="https://www.itechfever.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/computer-worm-768x509.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb20" alt="worm caught with chopsticks over a laptop."width="700">
			<p>Here are few well know worms like ILOVEYOU which transmitted through emails and cost businesses 5.5 billion US dollar in damage. The Code Red worm damaged 359,000 websites around the globe, SQL Slammer slowed down the entire web for an extended period, and the Blaster worm would force your PC to reboot continuously.</p>
			<p>Today’s security standards make it difficult for a worm to infect user’s PC via network, but none of the security measures can guarantee that they would be able to stop any future worm. However, make sure your Firewall is on and use good security software to avoid probable worm attacks.</p>
		<h3>Trojan Horse</h3>
			<p>Trojan is another kind of malware which looks harmless, but it contains malicious code which creates a backdoor that allows your PC to be controlled remotely. The term Trojan horse came into existence from the Troy Story where the Greeks used a wooden horse to infiltrate Troy.</p>
			<img src="https://www.itechfever.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/trojan-horse.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb20" alt="Monument of the wooden horse used to conquer Troya."width="700">
			<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2398.0897822196225!2d26.2364382321291!3d39.957000554469296!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x0!2zMznCsDU3JzI3LjAiTiAyNsKwMTQnMjAuMCJF!5e1!3m2!1ses!2ses!4v1619744379733!5m2!1ses!2ses" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>Unlike virus trojan <strong>doesn’t replicate itself</strong>, a trojan gets installed by users unknowingly. Once Trojan has infected your PC it can be used for different malicious purpose, like <strong>sending out spams</strong>, attacking a network or computer, DDoS attack on any website, spreading viruses, deleting files, stealing data, activating and spreading other malware.</p>
			<p>In simple words, trojan creates <strong>backdoor</strong> which gives access to malicious users, once they are able to control your PC they can do whatever they want.</p>
			<p>So how these Trojans can get access to your system? If you ever tried to download a <strong>crack, keygen</strong> or any program to get the full version of any software then you might get affected by such trojan, think why would anyone create a crack for software? What they are getting in return? First, they may get advertising revenue from the crack hosting sites, but such scammer has <strong>bigger goals</strong> they create trojan and attach them to cracks and keygen, once you install a crack you also install those trojans which put your computer at high risk.</p>
			<p>So avoid using cracks, keygen or patch for any software.</p>	
		<h3>Virus</h3>
			<p>The most common word used for any bad software, however, we use the term <strong>“malware”</strong> now. A virus is a program which can <strong>self-replicate itself</strong> after infecting a computer, it attach itself to other programs and get installed while installing the genuine software. After the execution of <strong>viral code</strong> it may destroy host files and starts infecting files into a PC, from there it creates a replica of itself and travels from PC to PC via external drive, the Internet, and malicious websites.</p>
			<img src="https://www.itechfever.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/computer-virus-1.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb20" alt="Blue virus."width="700">
			<p>Like a biological Virus goes from one human to another and it spreads through the environment, touch, cough, etc. In the same way, a computer virus spread itself from files to files and then from one device to another. Computer virus attaches themselves to executable files and can attack into several parts of windows like the <strong>registry, services, or a specific software</strong>, some of them can attack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record">MBR</a> (master boot record), autorun scripts, BIOS and MS Office macros.</p>
			<p>Overall, a virus is designed to break into your computer, destroy files and the right software, corrupt your files, make your computer completely inoperable which may lead to the complete format of your PC.</p>
			<p>You can always make your PC safe using a good antivirus program with latest update and virus definition, always avoid suspicious files from email and rouge websites.</p>
		<h3>Spyware</h3>
			<p>Spyware is another type of malware which <strong>collects data</strong> from your PC without your knowledge and permission, spyware runs in the background and collects your personal information like your browsing pattern, sites you visit, email, cookies, saved data into browsers, website passwords and even credit card details.</p>
			<img src="https://www.itechfever.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/spyware.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb20" alt="Computer looking to its surroundings. It is not completely open, so it can hide very fast."width="700">
			<p>Spyware is similar to the Trojan horse in that users unknowingly install the product when they install some other software or freeware. Spyware exists as an independent program then can <strong>track your keystrokes</strong>, snoop on other files, change your default homepage, monitor your activity, stealing your personal information and send back them to the creators. Your data can be used in several malicious ways which include selling your data, targeted advertising, scams, spam or identity theft.</p>
        <h2>Software and hardware to protect networks</h2>
        <h3>What is Network Security?</h3>
            <p><a href="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/what-is-network-security">Network security</a> is any practice or tool designed and implemented to secure a network and its data. It includes software, hardware, and cloud solutions. Effective network security tools stop a wide range of cyberattacks, and prevent attacks spreading throughout the network in case of a data breach.</p>
            <p>In today’s cyber environment, every organization must implement network security processes and solutions to maintain the uptime of their online resources. All network security solutions are implemented in accordance with the core principles of network security.</p>
        <h3>Anti-Virus & Anti-Malware</h3>
            <p>Anti-virus and anti-malware protect networks from malicious software that is used by threat actors to create a backdoor that they can use to further infiltrate the network. It’s important to note that while there are similarities between anti-virus and anti-malware programs, they are not exactly the same.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><storng>Anti-Virus:</storng> Prevention-based, protects networks by proactively stopping endpoint devices from becoming infected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anti-Malware:</strong> Treatment-based, protects networks by detecting and destroying malicious programs that have infiltrated the network.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>As the nature of malicious software is continually evolving, implementing both network security options in conjunction is the best method for ensuring network security.</p>
        <h3>Application Security</h3>
            <p>Application security ensures that the software used throughout the network is secure. Application security is ensured by limiting the amount of software that is used, ensuring that software is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and that applications developed for use in the network are appropriately hardened against potential exploits.</p>
            <img src="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cyber-Security-Risks.png" alt="Elements of cybersecurity: application security, end user compilance, disaster recovery, network security, information security." width="700">
        <h3>Behavioral Analytics</h3>
            <p>Behavioral analytics is an advanced threat detection method that compares historical network activity data to current events in an effort to detect anomalous behavior. An example of this would be if a user typically uses a given endpoint device to access a specific database somewhere between 3-4 times per day on average, an instance where that user instead uses a new endpoint device to access a different database several times would be flagged for review.</p>
        <h3>DDoS Prevention</h3>
            <p>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks attempt to crash the network by overloading it with a large influx of incoming connection requests. <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/security/ddos-protection">DDoS prevention</a> solutions analyze incoming requests to identify and filter out illegitimate traffic in an effort to maintain the network’s accessibility for legitimate connections.</p>
            <p>DDoS attacks are either carried out through a distributed network of attackers that execute scripts to send a large volume of incoming requests to the network or through a widespread series of devices that have been compromised and converted into an orchestrated system known as a botnet. </p>
        <h3>Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</h3>
            <p><a href="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/data-loss-prevention-best-practices">Data loss prevention (DLP)</a> tools protect the data inside a network by preventing users from sharing sensitive or valuable information outside of the network and ensuring that data is not lost or misused. This can be accomplished by analyzing files that are sent via email, file transfers, and instant messages for data that is considered to be sensitive, such as personally identifiable information (PII). </p>
        <h3>Email Security</h3>
            <p><a href="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/email-security-best-practices">Email security</a> measures protect networks from phishing attacks that attempt to trick users into clicking links to malicious websites or downloading seemingly innocent attachments that introduce malware into the network. Email security tools proactively fight phishing by identifying suspicious emails and filtering them out before they reach the user’s inbox.</p>
            <p>According to the 2019 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), 94% of malware was discovered to have been delivered via email and 32% of data breaches involved phishing attacks. Email security tools complement anti-phishing training by reducing the volume of malicious emails that pass through the network and into the inboxes of users.</p>
        <h3>Endpoint Security</h3>
            <p>Endpoint security protects networks by ensuring that the devices that will be connected to the network are secured against potential threats. Endpoint security is achieved alongside network security by combining several other network security tools such as network access control, application security, and network monitoring.</p>
            <p>An <strong>endpoint device</strong> is any piece of hardware that is connected to a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), such as workstations, laptops, smartphones, printers, and mobile kiosks. </p>
        <h3>Firewalls</h3>
            <p>Firewalls are hardware appliances and software programs that act as a barrier between incoming traffic and the network. The firewall compares data packets that are sent over the network to predefined policies and rules that indicate whether or not the data should be permitted into the network. </p>
        <h3>Mobile Device Security</h3>
            <p>Mobile device security centers around limiting the access that mobile devices have to the network and ensuring that the security vulnerabilities of mobile devices that are permitted on the network are monitored and managed.</p>
            <p>Mobile device security measures include mobile device management (MDM) solutions that allow administrators to segment sensitive data on mobile devices, enforce data encryption, determine the applications that are permitted to be installed, locate lost or stolen devices, and remotely wipe sensitive data. </p>
        <h3>Network Monitoring & Detection Systems</h3>
            <p><a href="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/best-server-monitoring-tools-software">Network monitoring</a> & detection systems include a wide variety of applications that are designed to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic and respond to anomalous or malicious network activity. </p>
            <p>Examples of network monitoring & detection systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)</strong> scan network traffic for suspicious activity such as policy violations in an effort to automatically block intrusion attempts.</li>
                <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</strong> work similarly to IPS, with an emphasis on monitoring network packets and flagging suspicious activity for review.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Information And Event Management (SIEM)</strong> provide a detailed overview of network events using a combination of host-based and network-based intrusion detection methods. SIEM systems provide administrators with valuable log data for investigating security incidents and flagging suspicious behavior.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Network Segmentation</h3>
            <p><a href="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/network-segmentation-security">Network segmentation is a common network security practice</a> for reducing the ease of which network security threats can spread. Network segmentation involves classifying a larger network into multiple subnetworks, with each subnetwork being managed with its own unique access controls. Each subnetwork acts as its own unique network to improve monitoring capabilities, boost network performance, and enhance security.</p>
        <h3>Virtual Private Networks (VPN)</h3>
            <p>Virtual private networks provide secure remote access from a given endpoint into a network. A VPN encrypts all network traffic that goes through it to prevent the unauthorized analysis of data sent to and from the network. It is often used by off-site workers that need a secure connection to their company’s network, allowing them to access data and applications that are necessary for their role.</p>
        <h3>Web Security</h3>
            <p>Web security protects networks by proactively protecting endpoint devices against web-based threats. Web security technologies such as a web filter will use a database of known malicious or vulnerable websites to maintain a blacklist, block commonly exploited network ports, and prevent users from engaging in high-risk activities on the internet.</p>
            <p>Web filtering solutions can be configured to only allow pre-authorized domains that are on the web filter’s whitelist. When a whitelist is used the web filter will block access to all websites that are not on the whitelist. </p>
            <p>Web security products may also include capabilities for analyzing connection requests to a website and determining if the website meets the minimum security requirements of the network before allowing users to access it. </p>
        <h3>Wireless Security</h3>
            <p>Wireless security measures protect the network against vulnerabilities that are unique to wireless connections. Wi-Fi networks openly broadcast connections to nearby devices, creating added opportunities for nearby threat actors to attempt to access the network. Wireless security is enhanced through methods such as encrypting data passed over wireless networks, filtering MAC addresses to restrict access, and privatizing the network SSID to avoid broadcasting the name of the network.</p>
        <h2>Network protocols: SSL, HTTPS, IPv6</h2>
        <h3>SSL</h3>
            <p>Stands for "Secure Sockets Layer." SSL is a secure protocol developed for sending information securely over the Internet. Many websites use SSL for secure areas of their sites, such as user account pages and online checkout. Usually, when you are asked to "log in" on a website, the resulting page is secured by SSL.</p>
            <p>SSL <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/encryption">encrypts</a> the data being transmitted so that a third party cannot "eavesdrop" on the transmission and view the data being transmitted. Only the user's computer and the secure server are able to recognize the data. SSL keeps your name, address, and credit card information between you and merchant to which you are providing it. Without this kind of encryption, online shopping would be far too insecure to be practical. When you visit a Web address starting with "https," the "s" after the "http" indicates the website is secure. These websites often use <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/certificate">SSL certificates</a> to verify their authenticity.</p>
            <p>While SSL is most commonly seen on the Web (<a href="https://techterms.com/definition/http">HTTP</a>), it is also used to secure other Internet protocols, such as SMTP for sending e-mail and NNTP for newsgroups. Early implementations of SSL were limited to 40-bit encryption, but now most SSL secured protocols use 128-bit encryption or higher.</p>
        <h3>HTTPS</h3>
			<p>Stands for "HyperText Transport Protocol Secure." HTTPS is the same thing as HTTP, but uses a secure socket layer (SSL) for security purposes. Some examples of sites that use HTTPS include banking and investment websites, e-commerce websites, and most websites that require you to log in.</p>
			<p>Websites that use the standard HTTP protocol transmit and receive data in an unsecured manner. This means it is possible for someone to eavesdrop on the data being transferred between the user and the Web server. While this is highly unlikely, it is not a comforting thought that someone might be capturing your credit card number or other personal information that you enter on a website. Therefore, secure websites use the HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data being sent back and forth with SSL <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/encryption">encryption</a>. If someone were to capture the data being transferred via HTTPS, it would be unrecognizable.</p>
			<p>You can tell if a website is secure by viewing the URL in the address field of your <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/web_browser">Web browser</a>. If the Web address starts with <strong>https://</strong>, you know you are accessing a secure website. Most browsers will also display a lock icon somewhere along the edge of the window to indicate the website you are currently visiting is secure. You can click the lock icon to view the <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/certificate">secure</a> certificate that authenticates the website.</p>
			<p>So whenever you are asked to enter personal or financial information on a website, make sure that the URL starts with "https://" and that the lock icon appears in the window. Then you can be sure that the website is secure and any data you enter will only be recognized by your computer and the Web server.</p>
		<h3>IPv6</h3>
			<p>Every computer system and device connected to the Internet is located by an <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/ip_address">IP address</a>. The current system of distributing IP addresses is called IPv4. This system assigns each computer a 32-bit numeric address, such as 120.121.123.124. However, with the growth of computers connected to the Internet, the number of available IP addresses are predicted to run out in only a few years. This is why IPv6 was introduced.</p>
			<p>IPv6, also called IPng (or IP Next Generation), is the next planned version of the IP address system. (IPv5 was an experimental version used primarily for <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/streaming">streaming</a> data.) While IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which increases the number of possible addresses by an exponential amount. For example, IPv4 allows 4,294,967,296 addresses to be used (2^32). IPv6 allows for over 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 IP addresses. That should be enough to last awhile.</p>
			<p>Because IPv6 allows for substantially more IP addresses than IPv4, the addresses themselves are more complex. They are typically written in this format:<br><strong>hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh</strong></p>
			<p>Each "hhhh" section consists of a four-digit <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> number, which means each digit can be from 0 to 9 and from A to F. An example IPv6 address may look like this:<br><strong>F704:0000:0000:0000:3458:79A2:D08B:4320</strong></p>
			<p>Because IPv6 addresses are so complex, the new system also adds extra security to computers connected to the Internet. Since there are so may IP address possibilities, it is nearly impossible to guess the IP address of another computer. While most computer systems today support IPv6, the new Internet procotol has yet to be fully implemented. During this transitional process, computers are often assigned both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address. By 2008, the U.S. government has mandated that all government systems use IPv6 addresses, which should help move the transition along.</p>

		<h3>Digital certificates and certificate authorities</h3>
			<img src="https://www.comodo.com/images/support/certs6.gif" alt="CA gives the digital certificates to the peple." width="500">
			<p><a href="https://www.instantssl.com/#_ga=2.266502094.1937034386.1619592999-2084819854.1619592999">Digital Certificates</a> are issued by Certification Authorities (CA). Like a central trusted body is used to issue driving licenses or passports, a CA fulfil the role of the Trusted Third Party by accepting Certificate applications from entities, authenticating applications, issuing Certificates and maintaining status information about the Certificates issued.</p>
			<p>The incorporation of a CA into <a href="https://www.instantssl.com/what-is-pki#_ga=2.266502094.1937034386.1619592999-2084819854.1619592999">PKI</a> ensures that people cannot masquerade on the Internet as people they are not by issuing their own fake Digital Certificates for illegitimate use.</p>
			<p>The Trusted Third Party CAs will verify the identity of the Certificate applicant before attesting to their identity by Digitally Signing the applicant's Certificate. Because the Digital Certificate itself is now a signed data file, its authenticity can be ascertained by verifying its Digital Signature. Therefore, in the same way we verify the Digital Signature of a signed message, we can verify the authenticity of a Digital Certificate by verifying its signature.</p>
			<p>Because CAs are trusted, their own Public Keys used to verify the signatures of issued Digital Certificates are publicised through many mediums widely.</p>
			<p>The CA provides a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) that clearly states its policies and practices regarding the issuance and maintenance of Certificates within the PKI. The CPS contains operational information and legal information on the roles and responsibilities of all entities involved in the Certificate lifecycle (from the day it is issued to the day it expires).</p>
			<p>Digital Certificates are issued under the technical recommendations of the x.509 Digital Certificate format as published by the International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T).</p>
